### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
 
My Name is Fereshteh Aghaei and I am a self-motivated Data Analyst with a multi-disciplinary background in business management and data analytics. Currently I am wrapping up a 26 weeks of rigorous, fast-paced, advanced education in a Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp at the University of Denver, which has enhanced my skillset and helped me develop new ones. I gained expertise in technologies such as Excel, Python, JavaScript, SQL Databases, APIs, ML, Git/Github, and Tableau. I am currently studying for the AWS Cloud Practicioner Certification.

I strongly believe that the world is constantly evolving and that requires us to continuously grow as well, otherwise we become outdated. That's why I am always trying to grow    by learning new tools and studying popular trends.


âš¡Fun fact: I can read, write and speak 2 languages (Farsi and English) and Javascript was the hardest to learn ðŸ˜„
