### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹
 
My name is Fereshteh Aghaei, I am a self-motivated Business Data Analyst with a multi-disciplinary background in business management and data analytics. Working to Advance my education in a Data Analytics & Visualization at the University of Denver, which has enhanced my skillset and helped me develop new ones. During the passed year, I have gained expertise in technologies such as Excel, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL Databases, APIs, Machine Learning, Git/Github, Tableau and more. I am currently planning on studying for the AWS Cloud Practicioner Certification.

I strongly believe that the world is constantly evolving and that requires us to continuously grow as well, otherwise we become outdated. That's why I am always trying to grow    by learning new tools and studying popular trends.


âš¡Fun fact: I can read, write and speak 2 languages (Farsi and English) and Javascript was the hardest to learn ðŸ˜„
